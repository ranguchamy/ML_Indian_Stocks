Major spot LNG plays in our coverage universe are Gujarat State Petronet (GSPL), Gujarat Gas (GUJGA) and Petronet LNG (PLNG), which tend to benefit from lower rates. GSPL’s volumes can see fillip from sectors like power, refinery & industries, while GUJGA’s spreads are also likely to improve (as propane remains steady in Jan’24). PLNG’s tolling volumes can see an uptick, with higher demand for spot gas. We, however, note that JKM futures currently seems to bottom out at USD11/mmbtu in this cycle and it would be difficult to estimate the extent of any further decline in spot prices. Oil price volatility also persists, with China outlook still unclear, which poses a risk to propane prices as well. We hence maintain REDUCE on GUJGA with TP of Rs440, on expensive valuations. We uphold our constructive view on GSPL (BUY, with TP of Rs335/sh), as upcoming tariff clarity is a key trigger and, given GSPL’s healthy capex, the actual cut could be sizably lower than our 30% assumption. We reiterate BUY on PLNG (TP: Rs245), wherein the QatarGas contract renewal (potentially under favorable terms) could be a material positive trigger']\n",

With this additional expenditure, the government’s fertilizer subsidy for this year is now pegged at ~INR 1.88tn and food subsidy at INR 2.04tn.

Despite a promising start to the festive season, most categories (excluding jewellery and travel) seem to have hit the snooze button. Several factors contribute to this, including (1) the normalisation of ticket sizes and purchase frequencies, (2) weak footfalls (on a per sq foot basis), and (3) a trend towards downtrading. With a few exceptions, SSSG (especially for apparel and footwear) has ranged from -5 to 2%. Both retail and distribution channels continue to grapple with elevated inventory levels. This has led to (a) an early commencement of End of Season Sales (EoSS) by 2-3 weeks and (b) higher discount levels in the system. Consequently, margins are likely to be weak. While grocers continue to improve their GM portfolio, their apparel segment still needs fixing. On a positive note, the jewellery segment, courtesy the hand of Go(l)d, continues to perform well, led by robust wedding demand. However, ticket sizes have inched down.', 'Apparel, innerwear and footwear demand remains weak: Our interaction with key stakeholders/companies suggested that although the initial response in the festive season was healthy, demand took a beating from mid-Nov onwards in apparel, innerwear, and footwear. Sales densities were weak, with SSSG ranging from -5 to +2% by the third week of December. Ticket sizes have been normalising downwards as (1) articles per order declined and (2) a trend towards downtrading emerged. Purchase frequencies have dropped this fiscal (on a high base). In terms of sub-categories, Indian ethnic wear performance was good courtesy the festive/wedding season; however, menswear and women’s western wear, winter wear and innerwear continue to struggle. Note: there was some loss of sales in apparel and footwear during the World Cup days too. Expansion is likely to be measured in Q3. Likely relative outperformers in Q3FY24: (a) Trent (courtesy Zudio), (b) VMART (given a low base), and (c) Metro Brands.', 'Jewellery remains blessed by the hand of GO(L)D: Given the gold price tailwind (up 13% YoY till 20-Dec-23), most jewellery companies continue to do well in terms of growth. However, ticket sizes have inched down for the industry. Grammage (per store basis) continues to decline. Most companies have been aggressive in expanding YoY; hence growth rates are expected to be in the high-teens to mid-20% range. Note: area growth for Tanishq/Kalyan Jewellers/Senco Gold stands at 20/19/12% respectively YoY (H1FY24).', 'On inventory levels and margins: Inventory levels remain elevated in apparel/footwear/innerwear, both in retail and in distribution. Hence, most of the companies started an early EoSS (by 2-3 weeks), except Trent and Metro Brands, and the share of discounted sales remains high in the system. Given (1) moderating sales densities, (2) a higher share of discounted sales, and (3) sticky rental bills, margins are likely to be weak or contract in Q3. Jewellery margins are likely to be steady YoY.', 'Margin of safety missing: Most discretionary categories (ex-jewellery and travel) are staring at moderating growth, negative-to-flat SSSGs, and potential contraction in margins. Hence, we suspect the earnings downgrade cycle to continue. Add to that, the sector’s nosebleed valuations (universe trades at 57x Dec-25 P/adj. PBT), and we may be staring at a double-whammy of earnings/multiple derating. Likely relative outperformers in Q3: Titan, Trent, Metro Brands, VMART.']\n",

      "Paragraph Content: Mark Mobius, hailed as the Indiana Jones of emerging market investing, said he was not unduly perturbed about rich valuation multiples being assigned to Indian companies as traditional valuation metrics often overlooked the future growth potential of many of these firms. “While the current price to earning ratios may seem high, they primarily reflect past performance and don’t fully capture the prospective rapid growth in earnings, potentially making Indian stocks more attractive in the long term,” Mobius said in a blog post, that also highlighted his month-long trip to India last year covering nine cities. Investment timing should focus on solidly growing companies, as there are always opportunities to find firms that excel regardless of the market’s overall state, he said. Mobius said he is often asked about the right time to invest in Indian equities, currently labeled as “overvalued” by some analysts. For newcomers to the investing world, particularly those unable to research individual stocks, Mobius recommends choosing a well-diversified mutual fund managed by experienced and reputable investment professionals. “This approach offers a balanced entry point into the Indian market,” he said. The month-long trip, added Mobius, had revealed the incredible depth and variety of India’s cultural landscape. “I met many enthusiastic entrepreneurs and software engineers, and was deeply impressed by their positive spirit and enthusiasm to improve their companies and work,” he said.\n",

The analysis takes a closer look at consumer preferences through the demographic lens, offering trends into consumer behavior in the country by measuring in-store and online retail purchases across various sectors. In the B2C segment, retail consumption witnessed an annual increase of 9.3% in the key 11 sectors, during the April–September 2023 period. The FMCG and E-commerce sectors experienced an annual increase of 26.2% and 19.4% respectively, during Q2-FY24, reflecting rising consumer demand in these sectors amid easing inflation. The Aviation and Hospitality sectors saw annual growth of 29.7% and 12.8% in Q2-FY24 respectively, reflecting increased demand for travel, driven by large events such as the Cricket World Cup. The jewelry sector saw an annual growth of 7.1%, in contrast to a 4.6% decline in Q2-FY23, suggesting higher spending triggered by the wedding season and endorsing post-pandemic demand bounce-back. The large format retail sector experienced an annual increase of 7.8% in Q2-FY24, driven by factors such as rising incomes, urbanization, and changing consumer preferences. From a demographic perspective, Metro cities which had grown the fastest from Q2-FY23 to Q1-FY24, were outpaced in H1 FY24 by SURU (semi-urban and rural), which saw the fastest consumption growth of 9.2% YoY, triggered by improved discretionary spending and demonstrating tailwinds in the rural economy.\n",

      "Paragraph Content: Suman Chowdhury, Chief Economist and Head – Research, Acuité Ratings & Research, CY2023 has been a special year for the Indian economy when the performance of the economy exceeded expectations. GDP growth was well over 7.0% in two quarters of the year albeit supported by a favourable base. Government capital expenditure did the heavy lifting for the economy, driving core sector activity and demand for commodities such as steel, cement, and coal. Urban demand has been strong as reflected by a step up in passenger vehicle sales, online food deliveries, airline traffic, and hotel occupancies. On the other hand, there were indications of weaker rural demand due to the El Nino phenomenon and the shortfall in the Kharif crop CY2024 promises to be an interesting year with a confluence of some tailwinds and headwinds. The resilience in urban demand is one of the primary drivers of the current momentum in the Indian economy albeit there may be some impact of the latest RBI circular which seeks to tighten the sharp growth in consumer lending. The robust growth of 7.7% in H1FY24 is clearly not sustainable in the second half of the fiscal but there is a likelihood of the overall growth print reaching near 7.0% for FY24, given the momentum that has caught on to the economy. Nevertheless, one can’t ignore the risks accruing from the weaker agricultural growth, the geo-political risks and the possibility of a deeper global slowdown in CY24. We had revised our growth forecast for FY24 to 6.5% with some upside but we prefer to remain cautious on the growth prospects for FY25 at this stage. The outlook on the global markets, however, appears better in CY24. The expected reversal in Fed policy stance, India’s inclusion in J P Morgan bond indices, and the slowdown in the developed economies is expected to induce higher capital flows to India unless there are new geo-political risks and surprises in the upcoming Indian election outcomes. Interest rates in India are set for a gradual albeit back-ended moderation. Let’s hope that the Indian economy will continue to show its resilience despite all the anticipated turbulence.\n",

They can be treated as inputs but not conclusive evidence to doubt SEBI probe.” “The Govt of India and the SEBI to look into if there is any infraction of law by the Hindenburg report on short selling and if so, take action in accordance with law, the CJI said. Chief Justice DY Chandrachud further observed that the power to transfer investigation must be exercised in exceptional circumstances.

      "Paragraph Content: Indian benchmark indices, namely Sensex and Nifty, initiated the day with weakness on Wednesday, influenced by frail global cues. The 30-share BSE Sensex witnessed a decline of 251.5 points, opening at 71,640.98. Similarly, the NSE Nifty dropped 30.30 points, marking an early trade at 21,635.50. Analysts highlighted the necessity for fresh catalysts in both global and domestic markets, noting that prevailing positives have already been factored in. The indices witnessed some pullback in Tuesday’s sessions as the IT and the banking heavyweights witnessed some selling pressure, said Ruchit Jain, Lead Research, 5paisa.com. However, the overall market was not very negative and certain sectors such as Pharma and Oil & Gas continued their upmove, he said. “The overall data from the FIIs remain positive with minor unwinding seen, while in the options segment the put writers in the index had to cover their positions,” he added. Mandar Bhojane, Equity Research Analyst, Choice Broking, said: “Analysing Open Interest (OI) data, the highest OI on the call side is noted at the 21,800 level, followed by the 22,000 strike prices. On the put side, the highest OI is observed at the 21,500 strike price. This data provides insights into the levels where options traders have the greatest exposure.” Profit taking in banking, IT, auto and realty stocks took a toll on the markets, as expensive valuations prompted investors to pare their holdings, said Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd. “Besides, the ongoing conflict in the Red Sea has been making investors jittery as any flare-up in violence could trigger an upsurge in oil prices and weigh on the economy. The biggest negative catalyst: COVID-19 sub-variant JN.1 cases have seen a surge throughout India. Strictly speaking, if the last two days’ trading action on Dalal Street is any indication, then volatility could be seen going ahead,” he cautioned. Avdhut Bagkar, a Technical and Derivatives Analyst at StoxBox, observed global markets declining on Tuesday, following a similar trend seen at the close of 2023. US markets witnessed weakness, notably in technology stocks, reflecting a pullback after recent strength. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P500 tumbled on the year’s first trading day. Asia anticipates India’s factory activity data while monitoring escalating tensions in the Red Sea after Iran deployed a destroyer. RBI may announce a new 10-year benchmark bond soon. Oil prices fluctuated due to Red Sea tensions, while gold prices rose, expecting potential US Fed rate cuts. Additionally, the Supreme Court prepares to announce its judgment on petitions involving Adani Group allegations.

      "Paragraph Content: Avdhut Bagkar Technical and Derivatives Analyst, StoxBox. On the global front, Stocks moved mostly lower during trading on Tuesday, extending the pullback seen in the final trading session of 2023. The weakness in the US’ broader markets came as some traders continued to cash in on recent strength, particularly among technology stocks. Taking cues from Wall Street, the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P500 indexes tumble on the first trading day of the year. Investors in Asia await India’s factory activity data from S&P Global for December, while oil prices will also be closely watched following Iran’s deployment of a destroyer to the Red Sea that has ratcheted up tensions in the region. Further, RBI is likely to announce a new 10-year benchmark bond early next week or on January 8. On the commodity front, Oil prices were volatile today after Iran dispatched a warship to the Red Sea, as the situation remains tense in the critical waterway for global shipments that has seen vessels attacked by Yemen’s Houthi rebels. Meanwhile, Gold prices gained today, boosted by expectations of an easing of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve in 2024 as investors look forward to a slew of economic data this week that could shed more light on the timing of rate cuts. In the major development, Supreme Court will pronounce judgement on a batch of petitions seeking court-monitored investigation into the allegations made by made by the US-based Hindenburg Research against the Adani group of companies regarding violations of the stock market. Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty are eyeing a negative start to Wednesday’s trade in line with global market losses this morning. The benchmark index opened with selling pressure to mark the day’s low of 21555 in the opening hour, however, it managed to generate modest buying interest and recovered 100 points to close marginally above 21660. With this it marked the first lower low in the recent pullback rally making it a distribution day. The index is anticipated to invite further selling pressure on closing below the support of 21590\n",

      "Paragraph Content: Spot LNG prices have corrected by over 30% in the past 1-2 months to USD11-12/mmbtu currently, as the ongoing winter season peaks, with no major disruptions and the near-to-medium term supply outlook looking comfortable, as per our checks. Major spot LNG plays in our coverage universe are Gujarat State Petronet (GSPL), Gujarat Gas (GUJGA) and Petronet LNG (PLNG), which tend to benefit from lower rates. GSPL’s volumes can see fillip from sectors like power, refinery & industries, while GUJGA’s spreads are also likely to improve (as propane remains steady in Jan’24). PLNG’s tolling volumes can see an uptick, with higher demand for spot gas. We, however, note that JKM futures currently seems to bottom out at USD11/mmbtu in this cycle and it would be difficult to estimate the extent of any further decline in spot prices. Oil price volatility also persists, with China outlook still unclear, which poses a risk to propane prices as well. We hence maintain REDUCE on GUJGA with TP of Rs440, on expensive valuations. We uphold our constructive view on GSPL (BUY, with TP of Rs335/sh), as upcoming tariff clarity is a key trigger and, given GSPL’s healthy capex, the actual cut could be sizably lower than our 30% assumption. We reiterate BUY on PLNG (TP: Rs245), wherein the QatarGas contract renewal (potentially under favorable terms) could be a material positive trigger\n",
      "Paragraph Content: We expect pure play engineering research & development (ER&D) companies to benefit from the likely acceleration in ER&D spend, growing digitization, and rising share of sourcing. ER&D spend has a high correlation with industry cycles and is thus prone to macro factors in the short term. But many industries like Auto are undergoing significant technology transition/disruptions that are driving higher spends on ER&D—this would negate any near-term weakness in other segments due to macro factors. Developed economies are expected to face shortage of skilled talent which will drive sustainable opportunities and sourcing from the engineering talent-rich Indian market. Nifty IT index inched up ~8%/11% in the last 1M/3M, on hopes of higher rate cuts in USA in CY24. ER&D stocks also saw a similar/better upmove which may cap any near-term upside; however, improving medium-term growth outlook would support higher valuations, in our view.

      "Paragraph Content: We expect Q3 to be another robust quarter for hotels, with 10-25% YoY revenue growth for our covered companies. We see the strongest growth for Chalet Hotels, which benefits from capacity expansion and ARR growth. Chalet will also see its margin increasing YoY on operating leverage benefit. Lemon Tree would benefit from the start of Aurika Mumbai. Indian Hotels is expected to see consolidated revenue growth of ~10% YoY, with RevPAR reporting ~11% YoY growth for domestic hotels. Occupancies and ADR remain elevated. Our TP for all three names has increased due to roll forward by a quarter and increased multiple amid continued strength in the industry. We maintain ADD on all three names, aided by supportive macros. FTA picking up from below pre-COVID levels; domestic demand to stay strong As per HVS Anarock, RevPAR growth was >27% YoY in October and >6% YoY in November. Though the hotel occupancy rate fell 600bps YoY in November, primarily due to Diwali (which was in October in CY22), underlying demand in the industry remained strong. Domestic air travel continues to exhibit strength with the number of passengers increasing 9% YoY in Nov-23 to 12.7mn. For Jan-Nov 2023, domestic air passenger travel increased 25% YoY. FTA increased 18% YoY in Sep-23 and was up 20% YoY in Oct-23. FTA in India, as of YTDCY23, still stands below pre-COVID levels by ~16%. However, tourist arrival is picking up on a YoY basis. This indicates further scope for growth in FTA, which can support demand for hotels. Moreover, ARR levels are expected to pick up in Q4FY24, as business travel again resumes, following the holiday season. Q4 would also have weddings and conferences, which would support demand. Q3 preview: Chalet to deliver strong Q3; Lemon Tree to benefit from Aurika Chalet: We expect a strong Q3 for Chalet with RevPAR registering growth in the high teens YoY. We expect strong revenue growth of >25% YoY (>17% QoQ) for Chalet, aided by (i) robust ADR growth and occupancy in existing properties; and (ii) property expansion. Moreover, we expect margins to improve 500bps YoY (450 bps QoQ) to 40.4% on operating leverage benefit. Chalet can continue to benefit as business travel picks up in Q4. Lemon Tree: We expect revenue to increase 17.4% YoY/20.7% QoQ, supported by the start of Aurika Mumbai in Q3, though this can be a drag on occupancy. We expect EBITDA margin to decline 380bps YoY (>550bps QoQ) to 50.3% due to higher costs YoY. We remain positive on LTH’s earnings and margin trajectory, prompted by: i) the opening of Aurika, Mumbai Skycity, in Oct-2023; and ii) further addition in the managed and franchise portfolios. IHCL: For IHCL, we expect ~10% YoY revenue growth in Q3FY24. We expect consolidated margins to be flat at 35.8% in Q3 (>37bps QoQ; >1100bps QoQ). Our TP has increased due to roll forward of estimates by a quarter to December and an increase in EV/EBITDA multiple amid continued strength in the industry.

      "Paragraph Content: The Centre’s fiscal position is comfortable despite additional spending amid buoyant tax and non-tax revenue. Front loading of capital expenditure continues to yield much-needed fillip to growth. We expect the Centre to achieve its targeted fiscal deficit of 5.9% of GDP in FY24E and target 5.4% for FY25E. We see the government relaxing the fiscal glide path, to push the target of 4.5% (meant earlier for FY26E, ahead by a year). Comfortable fiscal position; capex frontloading continues The Centre’s fiscal deficit was reported at 50.7% of BE during April-Nov FY24 versus 58.9% of BE in FY23. Continued buoyancy in revenue collections, both tax and non-tax, despite higher revenue expenditure will allow the government to comfortably achieve the targeted fiscal deficit of 5.9% of GDP. The quality of expenditure remains healthy, with the government frontloading capital expenditure – 58.5% of BE in FY24 versus 59.6% of BE in FY23, up 30.98% YoY. Overall revenue receipts grew by 20.87% YoY, outpacing the growth in total expenditure of 8.57% YoY during April-November FY24. Revenue expenditure growth remained modest at 3.5% YoY in April-November FY24, recording the slowest pace of growth in the past eight years as spending on subsidies accounted just 65% of the FY24BE, significantly narrower than 95% of FY23BE during April-November (due to subsuming of the Free Foodgrain Program into National Food Security Act). Revenue expenditure growth pale; to pick pace in coming months The Centre’s revenue expenditure growth eased to 3.6% YoY, the lowest since FY16 amid a sharp drop in subsidy spending. In the first eight months of the fiscal, the Centre spent INR 2.4tn on overall subsidies, which is down by 19% YoY. However, the Central government has recently presented the first batch of supplementary grants. The net cash outgo is pegged at INR 583.78bn in FY24. As per break-down of the net cash outgo, the government has sought an additional INR 133.5bn in cash for fertilizer subsidy, and INR 70.2bn as an additional amount for food subsidy on account of extension of PM-Garib Kalyan Anna Yojna (PMGKAY). With this additional expenditure, the government’s fertilizer subsidy for this year is now pegged at ~INR 1.88tn and food subsidy at INR 2.04tn. Apart from this, to cover the losses posted by oil marketing companies (OMCs) owing to domestic LPG operations (INR 75bn) and PM-Ujjwala Yojna, the Ministry of Petroleum is set to incur an additional INR 92bn expenditure. Retain 5.9% fiscal deficit target If the current trend of revenue is sustained, we see no fiscal slippages despite the expected shortfall in disinvestment revenue of INR 400bn. The disinvestment proceed shortfall would be offset by gains in non-tax revenue (+ 400bn) and higher tax revenue (INR 800 bn). Considering the additional cash outgo placed in First Supplementary Demand for Grants and likely additional expenditure in Second Supplementary Demand for Grants, we see the government comfortably meeting the fiscal deficit target of 5.9% of GDP amid higher-than-expected tax and non-tax revenue. We do not see the dynamics reversing despite likely second supplementary demand for grants.\n",
      "Paragraph Content: ONGC | Limited earnings growth prospects Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) stock rallied 40% and outperformed the Sensex by 21% in CY23YTD, as Brent crude price increased from USD 81/bbl at the beginning of CY23 to a high USD 96/bbl seen in Octoer 2023. However, going ahead we see limited upside to ONGC’s crude price realisation in the current environment of windfall tax (which has not allowed ONGC to earn more than USD 75/bbl since the levy of the tax on 1 July 2022), slowing global oil demand, strong non-OPEC+ oil production growth and increasing spare OPEC oil capacity. ONGC’s gas price realisation too is unlikely to change significantly, as APM gas price is frozen till March 2025 and 95% of ONGC’s gas sales fall under APM. We estimate the stock price factors ~USD 73/bbl oil price for FY25E. With limited earnings growth, we downgrade ONGC to REDUCE.\n",

      "Paragraph Content: HDFC Securities analysts -Jay Gandhi, Institutional Research Analyst and Tanuj Pandia, Institutional Research Analyst, HDFC Securities We recently interacted with numerous store managers and companies to assess the festive performance and demand in discretionary categories. Despite a promising start to the festive season, most categories (excluding jewellery and travel) seem to have hit the snooze button. Several factors contribute to this, including (1) the normalisation of ticket sizes and purchase frequencies, (2) weak footfalls (on a per sq foot basis), and (3) a trend towards downtrading. With a few exceptions, SSSG (especially for apparel and footwear) has ranged from -5 to 2%. Both retail and distribution channels continue to grapple with elevated inventory levels. This has led to (a) an early commencement of End of Season Sales (EoSS) by 2-3 weeks and (b) higher discount levels in the system. Consequently, margins are likely to be weak. While grocers continue to improve their GM portfolio, their apparel segment still needs fixing. On a positive note, the jewellery segment, courtesy the hand of Go(l)d, continues to perform well, led by robust wedding demand. However, ticket sizes have inched down. Apparel, innerwear and footwear demand remains weak: Our interaction with key stakeholders/companies suggested that although the initial response in the festive season was healthy, demand took a beating from mid-Nov onwards in apparel, innerwear, and footwear. Sales densities were weak, with SSSG ranging from -5 to +2% by the third week of December. Ticket sizes have been normalising downwards as (1) articles per order declined and (2) a trend towards downtrading emerged. Purchase frequencies have dropped this fiscal (on a high base). In terms of sub-categories, Indian ethnic wear performance was good courtesy the festive/wedding season; however, menswear and women’s western wear, winter wear and innerwear continue to struggle. Note: there was some loss of sales in apparel and footwear during the World Cup days too. Expansion is likely to be measured in Q3. Likely relative outperformers in Q3FY24: (a) Trent (courtesy Zudio), (b) VMART (given a low base), and (c) Metro Brands. Jewellery remains blessed by the hand of GO(L)D: Given the gold price tailwind (up 13% YoY till 20-Dec-23), most jewellery companies continue to do well in terms of growth. However, ticket sizes have inched down for the industry. Grammage (per store basis) continues to decline. Most companies have been aggressive in expanding YoY; hence growth rates are expected to be in the high-teens to mid-20% range. Note: area growth for Tanishq/Kalyan Jewellers/Senco Gold stands at 20/19/12% respectively YoY (H1FY24). On inventory levels and margins: Inventory levels remain elevated in apparel/footwear/innerwear, both in retail and in distribution. Hence, most of the companies started an early EoSS (by 2-3 weeks), except Trent and Metro Brands, and the share of discounted sales remains high in the system. Given (1) moderating sales densities, (2) a higher share of discounted sales, and (3) sticky rental bills, margins are likely to be weak or contract in Q3. Jewellery margins are likely to be steady YoY. Margin of safety missing: Most discretionary categories (ex-jewellery and travel) are staring at moderating growth, negative-to-flat SSSGs, and potential contraction in margins. Hence, we suspect the earnings downgrade cycle to continue. Add to that, the sector’s nosebleed valuations (universe trades at 57x Dec-25 P/adj. PBT), and we may be staring at a double-whammy of earnings/multiple derating. Likely relative outperformers in Q3: Titan, Trent, Metro Brands, VMART.\n",

Japan’s markets remained closed due to a holiday. In the US, the S&P 500 concluded with a loss of 27 points (0.57%) at 4,742.83, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 245.41 points (1.63%) to 14,765.94. Conversely, the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up by 25.5 points (0.07%) to reach 37,715.04. Meanwhile, oil prices retreated as investor sentiment moderated regarding potential rate cuts and alleviated concerns about disruptions in Red Sea supplies. Earlier, prices had surged approximately $2 per barrel after reported attacks on vessels by Houthi rebels and the alleged arrival of an Iranian warship on Monday. US crude settled at $70.38 a barrel, down by $1.27, while Brent dropped $1.15 to settle at $75.89 a barrel. Additionally, spot gold experienced a 0.2% decline, reaching $2,058.59 an ounce.\n",
